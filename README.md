# Task Manager API

This is a simple Task Manager API built with Node.js. The API is designed for managing tasks and includes a file upload feature using the `formidable` package. This project was created as a practice exercise for my course.

- File upload functionality using `formidable`
- Simple HTTP server for managing API requests

## Getting Started
